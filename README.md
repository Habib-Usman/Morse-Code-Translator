## Features 
- This only has very basic functions that can encode / decode morse code

## MVPS

- Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code
- Create JS functions that would allow the user to translate their English text into Morse Code or Morse Code into English text
- Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)
